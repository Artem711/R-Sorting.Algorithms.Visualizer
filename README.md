# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting algorithms are an essential chapter of a computer science curriculum at the undergraduate level. This group of algorithms provides a quick introduction to the principles and techniques of theoretical computer science and algorithm analysis due to its simple nature and relatively straightforward examination.

This React/Redux web (in TypeScript) application presents my own demo program for sortings algorithms, called "Sorting Visualizer", which visualizes the algorithms internals and their operations. See below for YouTube videos created with the demo.

## Source of inspiration

Main inspiration was from the amazing [animated sorting algorithms](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms) by David R. Martin
